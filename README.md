 A theme for Etterna 0.70.3

 In very early progress. Not suitable for actual use yet

Based on a 1920x1080 resolution instead of the default 640x480. If you use a small game resolution like 800x600, this theme may literally be unusable. At minimum it's recommended to use 1280x720 or above, but 1920x1080 or above is optimal. It also means you'll have to do modification if you want to bring stuff from this theme to other themes. Numbers for positions and scales won't match up with any other theme that I know of (Unless the numbers are specific to gameplay elements, like the notefield board. Gameplay is still 640x480 based).
