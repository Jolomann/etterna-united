 A theme for Etterna 0.70.3

 In very early progress. Not suitable for actual use yet

Based on a 1920x1080 resolution instead of the default 640x480. If you use a small game resolution, this theme will literally be unusable at very small resolutions. It also means you'll have to do modification if you want to bring stuff from this theme to other themes. Numbers for positions and scales won't match up with any other theme that I know of
